TODO (Almost) Everything :D

Systems
- Create communication methods from system runner (queries).
	- Could be done with yet not created Task class and some 
	  not-so-dumb pointers or with another cyclic i/o stream if we
	  want to avoid dynamic allocation (per query).
- Input system needs to be implemented.
- Systems need to notify when runner is allocated.
	- This requires extending the current thread api with
	  wait-for-event methods.

Profiler
- Current profiler is lacking implementation and output methods.
	- We should also profile System communication since the
	  underlying buffer shouldn't be resized if not needed
	  (that is, we need to find a good buffer size depending on
	  system framerates, the read-rate, and action write-rate).

Testing
- Make unit tests

Misc
- Game object model needs to be determined
	- Animation handler
